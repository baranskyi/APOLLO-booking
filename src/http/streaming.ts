/**
 * Streaming responses (ADR-0007 §3).
 *
 * Why this exists: on the deployed Worker the edge answers in ~100 ms while
 * the booking page took ~320 ms, because the page awaited D1 before emitting
 * a single byte. Streaming makes TTFB a function of edge render alone, which
 * is what the §7 budget actually measures.
 *
 * This is also exactly the kind of metric that can be gamed, which is why
 * ADR-0007 adds a time-to-first-slot budget alongside TTFB — flushing an empty
 * shell fast is not "instant" in any sense a user recognises. Both numbers are
 * held, and both are reported honestly.
 *
 * Note what is NOT set here: `cache-control: no-transform`. It was, to stop a
 * proxy buffering the stream — and it also forbids compression, so the booking
 * page shipped 14.7 KB uncompressed where the non-streamed landing page
 * brotli'd to 5 KB. Cloudflare streams and compresses at the same time; the
 * header bought nothing and cost 3x the bytes on the page whose weight is a
 * published budget (spec §7).
 */

/**
 * Stream a page: `head` goes out immediately, `body` is awaited and appended.
 *
 * The parts are emitted in document order, so the browser parses and applies
 * the stylesheet in `head` while D1 is still being read — the paint is already
 * set up by the time the content lands.
