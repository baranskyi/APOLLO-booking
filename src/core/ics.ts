/**
 * iCalendar (.ics) generation — RFC 5545, with the scheduling semantics of
 * RFC 5546 (iTIP).
 *
 * Pure. No I/O, no clock: `DTSTAMP` is derived from the booking's own
 * timestamps rather than read from a clock, so the same booking always renders
 * byte-identical output. That is what makes this testable and what makes a
 * retried queue job produce an .ics a client recognises as the same object.
 *
 * Three things here are load-bearing and each of them breaks calendars quietly
 * rather than loudly when they are wrong:
 *
 *   1. UID + SEQUENCE decide UPDATE vs DUPLICATE. See `icsUidForBooking`.
 *   2. Content lines are folded at 75 OCTETS, not characters (RFC 5545 §3.1).
 *      A Cyrillic or emoji title is roughly two to four times longer in octets
 *      than in characters, so a character-based implementation emits lines that
 *      Outlook and older Exchange reject outright.
 *   3. TEXT values are escaped per §3.3.11; URI values are NOT. Escaping a URL
 *      turns `https://x/a,b` into `https://x/a\,b`, which some clients follow
 *      literally.

 * Chain depth is a perfect fit because it is derived from stored state rather

 *
 * `chain` is required for the same reason as in `icsRootBookingId`: without
 * the full lineage a two-hop booking's depth under-counts by one, which means
 * its SEQUENCE collides with the hop before it instead of exceeding it.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: `cancelled: true` must only ever be passed for a booking's OWN,
 * terminal cancellation — never to compute a CANCEL for the booking that a
 * *later* reschedule superseded. Two independent bookings each computing
 * their own depth-based SEQUENCE have no way to see each other, so a
 * superseded leg's "CANCEL, +1" and its replacement's "REQUEST" can land on
