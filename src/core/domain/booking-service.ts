/**
 * The booking write path (ADR-0002).
 *
 * The ordering here is the design, so it is worth stating plainly:
 *
 *   1. resolve the event type and its hosts
 *   2. for round-robin, pick a host — by weight, then least-recently-booked
 *   3. re-validate the slot against fresh availability + freeBusy
 *   4. write the booking and its slot_locks in ONE batch
 *   5. only then talk to calendars, email and webhooks
 *
 * Step 4 is what makes double-booking impossible; everything before it is an
 * optimisation that turns a doomed write into an early, clean 409. Step 5 is
 * deliberately after the commit — an external calendar failing must not lose a
 * booking we already promised the guest.
